- `HUBOT_SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` - The slack verification token for your application

Note that `HUBOT_JIRA_USERNAME` should be the JIRA username, this is
not necessarily the username used if you log in via the web.  To
determine a user's username, log in as that user via the web, and check
the user profile.  Frequently, users may log in using an email address such
as 'bob@somewhere.com' or a stem, such as 'bob'; these may or may not match
the username in JIRA.

####A note about chat:jira user lookup
In order for direct messages (notifications) and a few other
username based commands to work JiraBot attempts to match JIRA users with chat
users by email address. This has been tested primarily on the [Hubot
Slack adapter](https://github.com/slackhq/hubot-slack) and may not work without modification on others.
The take away is that you must have the same e-mail address on both
services for this to work as expected.

####Notifications via Webhooks
In order to receive JIRA notifications you will need to setup a webhook.
You can find instructions to do so on [Atlassian's
website](https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-apis/webhooks).
You will need your hubot to be reachable from the outside world for this
to work. JiraBot is listening on `/hubot/jira-events`. Currently
the following notifications are available:

* You are mentioned in a ticket in either the description or in a
  comment
* You are assigned to a ticket
* The following notifications apply if you are assigned to the ticket:
    * A new comment is left on the ticket
* The following notifications apply if you are watching the ticket in
  question:
    * Work begins on the ticket (enters the In Progress state or similar)
    * The ticket is closed
    * A new comment is left on the ticket
